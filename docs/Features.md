# ElevateMind: Features Overview

ElevateMind offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to support your mental well-being journey. This document details the key functionalities and benefits of using the application.

## Core Features:

*   **Daily Check-in:** At the heart of ElevateMind is the daily check-in feature. This simple yet powerful tool allows you to quickly and easily record your mental state each day. You'll provide a mood rating (on a scale of 1-10), indicate your stress level (using a slider or dropdown), and optionally add a journal entry to reflect on your experiences. Autosave functionality ensures that your progress is automatically saved, even if you're interrupted.

*   **Visualized Progress Tracking:** Understanding your mental health trends is crucial for self-awareness and improvement. ElevateMind provides interactive charts (powered by Chart.js) to visually represent your mood and stress levels over time. You can easily identify patterns, track progress, and see the impact of positive changes. These visualizations offer a clear and motivating way to follow your journey.

*   **Personalized Dashboard:** Your dashboard serves as your central hub, offering a personalized overview of your mental well-being data. It displays your latest check-in, your visualized progress charts, and provides summary insights, such as weekly averages for mood and stress levels. This concise view allows you to quickly assess your current state and long-term trends.
